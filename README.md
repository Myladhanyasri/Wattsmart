# Energy Consumption Prediction

This project is a web application designed to predict energy consumption using machine learning and provide users with a dashboard to visualize energy usage trends and receive energy-saving recommendations. It takes environmental inputs like lights usage, indoor and outdoor temperature, humidity, and wind speed, then uses a trained RandomForestRegressor model to predict energy consumption in watt-hours (Wh). The app is built using Flask for the backend, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, making it a practical tool for anyone looking to monitor and optimize their energy usage.

The file structure of the project is organized as follows: the root directory `Energy-Consumption-Prediction/` contains `Backend/ml_model/` where the main project files reside, including `app.py` (Flask backend server), `train_model.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook to train the ML model), and a `templates/` folder with `index.html` (form page for input) and `dashboard.html` (dashboard page for visualization). Outside the `Backend/` folder, the root directory also includes `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies), `README.md` (project documentation), `LICENSE` (license file), and `.gitignore` (Git ignore file).

To run this project, you’ll need the following requirements: Python 3.8 or higher, a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), and Jupyter Notebook for training the model. The Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are `flask==2.0.1`, `flask-cors==3.0.10`, `numpy==1.23.0`, `joblib==1.1.0`, `scikit-learn==1.0.2`, `pandas==1.4.3`, and `jupyter==1.0.0`. You also need a dataset file named `energy_data.csv` with columns `lights` (W), `T_in` (°C), `RH_in` (%), `T_out` (°C), `Windspeed` (m/s), and `Appliances` (Wh). Hardware-wise, a computer with at least 4GB RAM and 1GB free disk space is required.

To set up and run the project, start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Myladhan/Energy-Consumption-Prediction.git` and navigate to the folder with `cd Energy-Consumption-Prediction`. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Place your `energy_data.csv` file in the `Backend/ml_model/` folder. Next, train the ML model by navigating to `cd Backend/ml_model`, running `jupyter notebook train_model.ipynb`, executing all cells to generate `random_forest_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl`, and closing Jupyter with Ctrl+C. Then, start the app by running `python app.py` from the `Backend/ml_model/` folder, open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser, enter values for lights usage, indoor temperature, indoor humidity, outdoor temperature, and wind speed on the form, click "Predict Appliance Lights Usage" to view the dashboard, and stop the app by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

An example usage would be entering the following values on the form: Lights Usage as 1 W, Indoor Temperature as 12°C, Indoor Humidity as 22%, Outdoor Temperature as 23°C, and Wind Speed as 22 m/s. After clicking "Predict Appliance Lights Usage," the dashboard will display the predicted energy usage (e.g., ~60 Wh, depending on your model), potential savings (e.g., ~3 Wh), and a tip like "Reduce light usage to save 5% energy."
