# Wattsmart ðŸŒŸ

Wattsmart is a sleek web app that uses machine learning to predict energy usage and provides an interactive dashboard with insights and energy-saving tips. Built with Flask, Scikit-learn, and Bootstrap, itâ€™s perfect for anyone looking to monitor and optimize energy consumption. The file structure includes `app.py` (Flask backend server), `train_model.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook to train the ML model), a `templates/` folder with `index.html` (form page for input) and `dashboard.html` (dashboard page for visualization), a `static/` folder with `logo.png` (project logo), `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies), `README.md` (project documentation), `LICENSE` (license file), and `.gitignore` (Git ignore file). Youâ€™ll need Python 3.8 or higher, a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), Jupyter Notebook, and a dataset (`energy_data.csv`) with columns `lights` (W), `T_in` (Â°C), `RH_in` (%), `T_out` (Â°C), `Windspeed` (m/s), and `Appliances` (Wh). Hardware requirements include a computer with 4GB RAM and 1GB free disk space. To run the project, clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Myladhan/Wattsmart.git`, navigate to the folder with `cd Wattsmart`, install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, place your `energy_data.csv` in the folder, train the ML model by running `jupyter notebook train_model.ipynb` and executing all cells to generate `random_forest_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl`, then close Jupyter with Ctrl+C. Start the app with `python app.py`, open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser, enter values for lights usage, indoor temperature, indoor humidity, outdoor temperature, and wind speed on the form, click "Predict Appliance Lights Usage" to view the dashboard, and stop the app by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.
